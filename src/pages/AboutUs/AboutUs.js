        When we see a beautiful piece of clothing, on a subconscious level, we
        realise that its beauty comes from being made with love. Colours
        thoughtfully put together, embroidery and mirror-work delicately sewn by
        artisans, buttons gleaming in contrast. These are details that transform
        a piece of fabric into a work of art. <br />
        <br />
        Since I was young, I have always had an eye for this detail. And so, I
        naturally flowed into the study of textiles at the School of Fashion
        Technology in Pune. I carried this technical know-how to Future Group
        where I worked as a Visual Merchandiser for 3 years. <br />
        <br /> In 2017, following a successful balancing act as a full-time
        mother and a part-time designer, my partner encouraged me to find my
        true calling. In the spirit of doing what I loved, I began with a single
        sewing machine in my living room. Soon, I moved into my own little
        studio in Aundh where I customized outfits for my clients, under the
        name 'Trends Design Studio'.
        <br /> <br />
        With the world slowing down in 2020, I decided to breathe life into my
        longtime dream and created my own label, Trends. This is driven by my
        undying love for India's heritage crafts. Through our online presence, I
        wish for my brand of contemporary Indian Ethnic Wear to be accessible to
        every corner of the world.
        <br />
        <br /> Brand Trends is designed to harmonize a balance between modern
        technology and handmade precision, to bring beautiful designs for our
        clients. Our artisans are as special and important to us as those who
        buy into our brand. After all, it's threads of love that weave us all
        together.
